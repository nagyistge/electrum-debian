Description: Easy to use bitcoin client
 This package provides a light weight bitcoin client which protects
 you from loosing your bitcoin in a backup mistake or computer
 failure. Also electrum does not require waiting time because it does
 not download bitcoin block chain.
 .
 Features:
   * Instant on: client does not download block chain, uses remote
     server
   * Forgiving: wallet can be recovered from secret seed.
   * Safe: seed or private keys are not sent to the server,
     information received from the server is verified using SPV.
