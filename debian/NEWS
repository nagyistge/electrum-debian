electrum (2.4.2+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    This is the first upload of Electrum 2.0+ in Debian. When upgrading
    from a wallet created by an older version of Electrum, it is a good
    idea to have both an offline (eg. paper) backup of your wallet seed,
    as well as an electronic copy of your wallet file if you need to use
    it with a pre 2.0 Electrum version.

    The first launch of Electrum 2.0+ will upgrade your wallet to the new
    format; this requires regenerating all of the addresses in your
    wallet, and may take some time if you have a large wallet. Once the
    upgrade is complete, you will need to restart Electrum in order for
    any addresses to show up in the "Addresses" tab. The new format is not
    readable by versions of Electrum prior to 2.0.
